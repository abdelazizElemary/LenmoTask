# About
This is a code script that handles the use case that i delivered in the email, I have done as much test cases to check if the investor can lend money more than found his balance and also to check wether the balance is added with the profit or not and many more test cases to check the interest rate correctly calculated on different period inputs.

# To Test
run in your shell python app.py
